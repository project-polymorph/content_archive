## Methodology { data-search-exclude }

The F&M Global Barometers LGBTQI+ Perception Index (GBPI) is a pioneering survey that documents the lived human rights reality of LGBTQI+ people globally. The first iteration was launched in June 2022 and the subsequent version will be live from August-November 2024.

The GBPI asks six basic questions on personal safety, safety in gathering, acceptance, discrimination, fear of police, and violence. The survey adheres to human subjects guidelines and was approved by Franklin & Marshall College’s Institutional Review Board. Respondents complete the survey via the Internet and choose answers on a Likert scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Responses are random and anonymous. Each country is assigned a letter grade of A-F and assessed on a number scale where A (100%) is the highest and F (0%) is the lowest.

The survey is available in 15 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Thai, and Urdu. It was developed and is disseminated in partnership with dating apps (Grindr, Eden, and HER) as well as LGBT+ NGOs, including Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Center for Opinion Research, Center for Values in International Development, Council for Global Equality, Franklin & Marshall College, Global Philanthropy Project, InterPride, LGBTI Global Human Rights Initiative, Outright International, and Tower Marketing.
