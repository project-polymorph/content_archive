### Equality Magazine: Fall 2024

### [Hope](https://www.hrc.org/magazine)

The 2024 election featured some devastating setbacks for people who believe in progressive ideals and full equality for the LGBTQ+ community. But amid that darkness, there are some bright lights of hope. Sarah McBride is one of the trailblazers who is living proof that progress cannot be stopped. As the LGBTQ+ community grows, we will continue to elect diverse LGBTQ+ members of Congress so that every American can see themselves represented in our government. This sends a message to the queer and trans youth who have been under unprecedented attack over the past few years that a successful future where they have a seat at the table is possible.
